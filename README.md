Windows operating system Windows Batch script (CLI - command line interface) current hardware clock 

Dear,

Windows batch script CLI(command line interface) of the clock of windows operating system :  

only 4 lines of code, and the extension of the file may be ('.bat'), it only work on windows operating system, by the doucle click on the file the CLI batch script program is working and showing off the curent hardware clock of the current computer machine printing the second every second on the screen  :  'rem' keyword  only stands for comments  

:loop rem ':loop' infinite loop method 
echo %date%%time% rem 'echo %date%%%time' stands for printing the current date and time of current hardware. 
timeout /t 1 /nobreak rem 'timeout /t 1 /noreak stands for giving an offset/delay after 1 second after each print of the current time' 
goto :loop rem 'goto :loop' stands for starting the infinite loop again from the first line, actually ':loop'  

To exit the program you may easily close it by the 'x' top right close symbol of the window or use a short key as ctrl+c(control bottom left key of the windows keyboard + c as letter on the keyboard and closing the window).  This program doesn't affect any working of the operating system of the files and is just showing off the clock on a print screen, to controle the correctness of the date and time.  

Thank you for your comprehension and thank you very much in adavance.  

Sincerely, 
Cordially,
