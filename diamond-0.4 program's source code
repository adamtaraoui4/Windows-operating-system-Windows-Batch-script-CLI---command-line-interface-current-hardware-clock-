rem example of heat in 4d canvas :
rem best isolator material is diamond, 
rem you may find it easily concatenating every 
rem kind of perimeter in the air.
rem isolates every piece having an usual 
rem characteristic in comparison with other ones.
rem formal example : forest fire, closing the air 
rem perimeter of the fire by the air 
rem -> the formule of the diamond in the air as 
rem described before put out the fire in this perimeter 
rem (-> controlling the perimeter 
rem with the same equation 24 hour +, 
rem for formal/explicit security of out of the fire).
rem diamond formule in the air using a computer and 
rem an infrared sensor to detect warm piece unusual 
rem in the cosmos(the earth(continents, 
rem cities, countries, oceans, seas, 
rem furniture, rubber furniture, other kind of furniture, 
rem diamond as an equation contains every material like rubber, 
rem from diamond, we may transform the diamond to rubber
rem and from rubber, we may transform 
rem the diamond and the rubber to any raw material
rem and from rubber every raw material 
rem of beings(human beings, beings), infrastructure)).
rem example : diamond is very cold, preserves the atoms 
rem of every material without changing any formule
rem never breaths(contains no oxygen) and may isolate, 
rem secure the perimeter in the cosmos and certainly 
rem the earth and other planets, those are described as air canvas, 
rem by isolating the dynamic pieces causing already 
rem a temperature issues, may cause it in the future
rem (within a second, minute, year, decades).
rem example : 4d dimensional canvas 
rem of the planet earth and outside the cosmos
rem in the windows bash/shell cli(command-line-interface)
rem take a file (*.txt), (*.log) extension 
rem as data for own data structure/infrastructure
rem as data to crud(create-read-update-delete)
rem and isolate the the unusual temperature
rem example : diamond air equation (perimeter of air good concatenated, 
rem concatenated untill no more extra cold 
rem in comparison with the previous sequence of air. 
rem x = 1,y = 1,z = 1 -> merging x,y,z gives a sum 3 
rem with dynamic perimeter between the parameter 
rem and empty x = 0,y = 0,z = 0) may isolate every 
rem virus from the air and preventing it from propagation.
rem example : beings cuffs, same equation of 
rem diamond in the air by for example taking the same 
rem perimeter of the air where the cuffs are dimensional, 
rem present in the perimeter, taking a copy of the same air perimeter 
rem on another perimeter where agressive beings, (for example : agressive dogs, 
rem forest, oceans, seas beings) (or other kind of beings) 
rem to protect ourselves and our alimentation beings 
rem (cow, chicken, (other kind of alimentation beings)), 
rem cuffs the beings for security(worldwide solution).
rem example : canvas air can be used as any unit test perimeter in the air
rem to continue searching for better handleware evaluations and equations 
rem outside the real world perimeters for formal/explicit 
rem security reasons and better use.
rem example : extra fahrenheit, celsius on the earth 
rem can be isolated by using 
rem a cold fahrenheit, celsius on the point itself, 
rem and his continuous neural network suite(s) 
rem of heat described as extra fahrenheit, 
rem celsius as unusual from the usual one. (example : heat above infrastructure 
rem cities, countries, planets, cosmos)
rem example : forest fire, atoms of fire in the cosmos 
rem closing air on them by the diamond equation 
rem and controlling the same perimeter and other perimeter continuously, 
rem infinitely without stop, a program as a 
rem server(continuous a computer working infinitely without stop).
rem example : detecting the perimeter, 
rem subscribing the data in a file data (*.txt), (*.log)
rem setting it as a cold fahrenheit, celsius point(s) 
rem in the perimeter will put out the fire, 
rem and continuously controlling this perimeter.
rem neural network paradigm : subscribing data in different files 
rem searching always controlling makes data useful, 
rem may be rendered for statistics, but the program has always 
rem to be running as a server for formal/explicit use and summed up 
rem without a choice of probability calculation, 
rem the date and time is always going forward, weather 
rem changes continuously a server always working with useful 
rem instructions guidelines will be correct science, 
rem a program based on secure and correct science, 
rem learning every microsecond infinitely without stop.

rem for security of cosmos.
rem a single chain, array may contain 
rem too much information about a perimeter
rem can be stored in a data file, 
rem than used as a neural network by multiple data files
rem in an infinite loop.(program called server).

rem (-> implicates lower lever language from the computer) 
rem to keep the date and time arranged manually

rem ### date and time paradigm solution, if through 
rem telecommunication or hardware issue corrupted, not working well
rem changing the day if 29, 28 of month february, 
rem array manipulation - known also as substring manipulation - 
rem string manipulation of the array - chain of character
rem the other months of the year are keeping the same numbers
rem leap year contains 366 days
rem ever month february is going to 29 days, a not leap year
rem contains 365 days, ever month february is going to 28 days
rem the other months of the year are keeping the same numbers 
rem with this software you may arrange your current
