rem ###
rem Current next windows bash/shell cli(command-line-interface) code/pseudocode
rem renders the current hardware timestamp of the machine hardware via software
rem using the windows bash/shell cli(command-line-interface) windows bash/shell
rem already also named as windows the command prompt. 
rem ### current hardware timestamp print every 1 second going forward
rem :loop rem an infinite loop function, method
rem echo Press ctrl+c, ctrl+d to stop the print of the time : %date%-%time% rem the date and time is printed with the cli(command-line-interface) function, method 'echo'
rem timeout/t 1 /nobreak rem loop waits 1 second without break
rem goto :loop rem jumping to the loop above again, to print out again the time again
rem ### Importancy of having the correct clock 
rem ### Maintained every microsecond of the day worldwide 
rem using a wide protocol as GMT(Greenwich Mean Time) - 
rem UTC(Coordinated Universal Time) :
rem ### Worldwide bylaw(s)-contract(s) defined as :
rem Electronic (acknowledge)-(back-knowledge) 
rem (rules of handshakes) requests : every hardware/software transaction.
rem example : bank transaction(s) - electronic mail(s) (e-mail(s)) 
rem -> electronic letter -> feedbacks, appointments, review(s) 
rem -> bylaw(s), contract(s)
rem hardware software may definitely not telecommunicate, 
rem or not correctly using uncorrect time protocol gateway(s).
rem -> current issue of the time, current time year hardware iteration 
rem -> days of the clock are going on recurrent with the same year 
rem (example of : 2024-2025) without leap or not leap year 
rem (-> difference of 366, 365 days -> crucial issue for local, 
rem worldwide transaction(s)) in other words 2024 - 2025 iterated, 
rem recurated multiple years.
rem Roomy transactions issue(s) already subscribed
rem in bylaw(s)-contract(s) telecommunication(s) 
rem Print papers bylaw(s)-contract(s) : 
rem every already printed out bylaw(s)-contract(s).
rem Backups ((digital, non-digital) -> the electronic 
rem (like in computer) and printed out (like in papers)) 
rem bylaw(s)-contract(s) evidence(s).
rem Future electronic or none electronic bylaw(s)-contract(s).
rem Wide private bylaw(s)-contract(s) examples :
rem commerce, e-commerce(electronic commerce) 
rem for the business-to-business, business-to-concumer, 
rem consumer-to-business, consumer-to-consumer.
rem Wide gouvernemental bylaw(s)-contract(s) examples :
rem every digital and none digital bylaw(s)-contract(s)
rem beside absolute private bylaw(s)-contract(s) 
rem in private structure(s)/infrastructure(s) 
rem using other kind of protocol(s).

rem Solution of the current time issue already described 
rem by the windows bash/shell cli(command-line-interface) 
rem already subscribed in the WIPO(World Intellectual Property Organization) 
rem program software diamond-0.4 by the founder's name : adam taraoui -

rem ### small memo notice : taking a current print 
rem of the clock and going from, starting from 31/12/2025, 
rem using a low-level programming language, 
rem in our case the windows bash/shell programming language,
rem in other words using a software program as a worldwide solution 
rem (the computer hardware is using a hardware clock, 
rem the hardware clock is using an international 
rem worldwide compass material protocol)
rem example : your computer is setting the normal 
rem clock of the area automatically when booted up again(restarting), 
rem in an other area and getting the clock of 
rem the area as a hardware clock shown by the operating system, 
rem as GMT(Greenwich Mean Time) - 
rem UTC(Coordinated Universal Time).
rem Using the cosmos and the earth 
rem gravity magnets of GMT(Greenwich Mean Time) - 
rem UTC(Coordinated Universal Time) in the world.
rem ### solution of the recurent year solution :
rem Current year forward after the new year with 
rem a new forward timestamp 2025-2026-2027-... 
rem formal calculation, evaluation of leap and not leap year.
rem taking a printscreen from 31/12/2025, 
rem and going forward by a low-level software program 
rem like windows bash/shell programming language.  
rem Example of a next current useful solution assistance : 
rem going with a memo-sticker printer, 
rem sticking current document(s) map(s) with a timestamp memo-sticker, 
rem -> the correct timestamp labelling.
rem for endless deep time calculation, evaluation 
rem we may use archeology's oxygen isotope analisys for perfect solution(s).
rem ### example of : an old bylaw used in a correct context 
rem of timestamp without bylaw timestamp's problems, 
rem will give the correct timestamp 
rem of the current bylaw with current or in wait timestamp's problems
rem using archeology's oxygen isotope analisys.
